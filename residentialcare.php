                        to live independently at home, it may be time to consider residential care.

                        At new Beginngs Care this doesn’t mean compromising on quality of life and independence. Rather
                        than
                        radically changing their lifestyles, our care homes provide safe, supportive environments in
                        which residents, relieved of the burden of maintaining a home – and all that that entails – can
                        instead focus their energies on living well and enjoying later life.</p>

                        new care home.
