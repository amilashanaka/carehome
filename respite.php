            <p class="lead">New Beginnings is proud to offer professional respite care of the highest quality, across
                its extended care homes family. They say that a ‘change is as good as a rest’ and professional respite
                care can provide the perfect ‘pick-me-up’ for residents – or a place to convalesce and gain strength,
                perhaps after a period of illness or a stay in hospital.

                Respite care also offers families and primary carers a break from their care commitments – perhaps
                necessary due to illness, freeing the time to take a holiday or simply to rest and recharge the
                batteries.</p>

                ranging from a matter of weeks to several months – within a safe, welcoming, and luxurious care
                environment offering 24-hour residential and nursing support.
                Some residents and their families or carers benefit from regular, recurring respite stays, allowing time
                for loved ones and everyone involved in their care to enjoy a break. And as many residents will attest,
                such is the level of luxury and facilities at New Beginnings Care, that many of our homes feel like 5*
                hotels!
