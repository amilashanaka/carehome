            <p class="lead">New Beginnings is proud to offer professional respite care of the highest quality, across
                its extended care homes family. They say that a ‘change is as good as a rest’ and professional respite
                care can provide the perfect ‘pick-me-up’ for residents – or a place to convalesce and gain strength,
                perhaps after a period of illness or a stay in hospital.

                Respite care also offers families and primary carers a break from their care commitments – perhaps
                necessary due to illness, freeing the time to take a holiday or simply to rest and recharge the
                batteries.</p>
