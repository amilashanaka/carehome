            <p class="lead">MACC Care is passionate about making a difference. It’s our priority that every resident
                receives the person-centric care that ensures wellbeing – on a physical level, but just as importantly,
                socially and emotionally too. Wellness stems from living fulfilled and meaningful days, so we provide
                opportunities for positive enrichment at every turn, within inspiring environments where residents can
                truly thrive.</p>
            <p class="lead">Delivering care of this quality calls for strong leadership and exceptional people.</p>

            <p class="lead fst-italic">“Working in care is more than a job. It’s a vocation. Seeing residents smile and
                gain a new
                lease of life – at a time when many may have given up on that – is what drives us.”</p>
