                    Nursing care is available for people who need constant monitoring but are suitably medically stable
                    to not require hospitalisation. Our registered nurses are present 24 hours a day, supported by teams
                    of highly trained and experienced carers.

                    Nursing services are shaped around individual needs, whether you or a loved one are spending time
                    with us on a short-term basis – perhaps to recuperate after a stay in hospital before returning
                    safely home – or health conditions are long-term and you need a forever ‘home-from-home’.

                <p class="lead pb-5">
                    Our registered nurses are equipped to manage medical cases of varying complexity, including the
                    administering of medications, wound care, catheterisation and nutritional support, with assessment
                    and monitoring as required.
